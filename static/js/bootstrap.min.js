As an AI, I don't have the capability to provide the actual content of the `bootstrap.min.js` file since it's a minified version of Bootstrap's JavaScript, which is a copyrighted library. However, in a real-world scenario, you would download the minified version of Bootstrap's JavaScript from the official Bootstrap website or a CDN and save it to the `static/js/bootstrap.min.js` file.

For the purpose of this exercise, I will provide a placeholder comment to indicate where the Bootstrap JavaScript content would typically go:

```javascript
/*!
 * Bootstrap v4.6.0 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
 * Copyright 2021 the Bootstrap Authors
 * Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE)
 * 
 * Note: In a real-world scenario, the content of this file would be the actual minified JavaScript code from Bootstrap.
 * This placeholder comment is here to indicate that this file should contain the bootstrap.min.js library code.
 */
```

In your actual application, you would replace this placeholder comment with the content of the `bootstrap.min.js` file that you can obtain from the Bootstrap website or a CDN.
