As an AI, I don't have the capability to directly access files such as the `bootstrap.min.css` from the Bootstrap framework. However, the `bootstrap.min.css` file is a minified version of the Bootstrap CSS framework. To obtain this file, you would typically go to the Bootstrap website or use a package manager like npm to install Bootstrap and then copy the `bootstrap.min.css` file from the distribution to your `static/css/` directory.

Since I can't provide the actual content of `bootstrap.min.css`, you would need to download it from the official source. Here's a general idea of what you would do:

1. Visit the Bootstrap website: https://getbootstrap.com/
2. Download the compiled Bootstrap CSS and JS from the download page, or use a CDN link.
3. If downloaded, extract the `bootstrap.min.css` file and place it in your `static/css/` directory.

If you're using a package manager like npm, you could run:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

Then, you would copy the `bootstrap.min.css` file from `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/` to your `static/css/` directory.

Remember, the code I'm providing here is not the content of `bootstrap.min.css`, but rather instructions on how to obtain it, as the actual content of the file is too long and complex to include in this format.
