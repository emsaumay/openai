1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files for styling. It will contain various DOM elements with unique id names that can be targeted by JavaScript functions if needed.

2. "styles.css": This is the custom CSS file for the website. It will contain styles that are not covered by Tailwind CSS. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file. It's a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It will be linked in the "index.html" file and will be used to style the DOM elements defined there.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the CSS files to apply styles to specific elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers used to target elements for styling. They are defined in the CSS files and used in the "index.html" file.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in the CSS files to select and style HTML elements based on their id, class, type, etc.

4. HTML Element Tags: These are used in the "index.html" file to create HTML elements. They are targeted in the CSS files for styling.

5. File References: The "index.html" file will have references (links) to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. These are necessary for the CSS files to be applied to the HTML file.

Note: As the prompt does not mention JavaScript, no JavaScript function names or message names are included. If JavaScript was involved, function names, event names, and possibly variable names would be shared dependencies as well.
