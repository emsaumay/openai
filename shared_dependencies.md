1. React: All the JavaScript files in the "src" directory will share the React library as a dependency. This includes the use of React's built-in functions such as `React.createElement`, `React.Component`, and the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

2. ReactDOM: The "src/index.js" file will use the `ReactDOM.render` function to render the main App component into the root DOM node.

3. App Component: The "src/index.js" file will import the main App component from "src/App.js". The App component will in turn import and use the Home, About, Projects, Contact, Footer, and Header components from their respective files in the "src/components" directory.

4. CSS Modules: Each component file in the "src/components" directory will import its corresponding CSS module from the "src/styles" directory. For example, the Home component will import "src/styles/Home.css", the About component will import "src/styles/About.css", and so on.

5. Tailwind CSS: All the CSS files in the "src/styles" directory will use Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The Tailwind configuration will be shared via the "tailwind.config.js" file.

6. Public Assets: The "public/index.html" file will link to the "public/favicon.ico" and "public/manifest.json" files. The "src/index.js" file will use the id of the root DOM node ("root") to render the App component.

7. Package.json: All the dependencies and scripts for the project will be listed in the "package.json" file. This includes dependencies such as React, ReactDOM, and Tailwind CSS, as well as scripts for starting the development server, building the production bundle, and so on.

8. PostCSS: The "postcss.config.js" file will contain the configuration for PostCSS, which will be used to process the Tailwind CSS classes in the CSS files.
